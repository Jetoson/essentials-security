# Asymmetric Cryptography

Asymmetric Cryptography is a cryptography system that uses two keys: a public key(which as the name suggests may be known by others) and private key(which must only be known by the owner)

## RSA

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a powerful asymmetric encryption algorithm widely used in modern
cryptography.
It heavily relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers to ensure secure communication.
RSA uses a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
We will work with the form of RSA with keys represented by numbers.
RSA is extensively employed for secure online transactions, digital signatures, secure email communication,and authentication protocols.
Its strength lies in its resistance to brute-force attacks, making it a fundamental component of secure communication in today's interconnected world.
